// What is the output of: true + false, "5" - 2, "5" + 2?

// 1. true + false = 1
// Because true stands for 1 and false as 0

// 2. "5" - 2 = 3
// Because "5" implicitly turns into number and does arthmetic operation

// 3. "5" + 2 = "52"
// Gives us 52 because + operator which means concatention.
